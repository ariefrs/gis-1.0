$('#new_price').val().replace(/[^\d\.]/g, '');

The way this regex works is as follows:

/  -> start of regex literal
[  -> start of a "character class". Basically you're saying I to match ANY of the
      characters in this class.
^  -> this negates the character class which says I want anything that is NOT in 
      this character class
\d -> this means digits, so basically 0-9.
\. -> Since . is a metacharacter which means "any character", we need to escape 
      it to tell the regex to look for the actual . character
]  -> end of the character class
/  -> end of the regex literal.
g  -> global flag that tells the regex to match every instance of the pattern.
